# Multi-Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning

---

## Project Overview

This project implements an **Ensemble Learning** solution for **multi-disease prediction** based on patient-reported symptoms. It is a **multi-class classification** problem that trains and combines the predictive power of three different machine learning models: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest**. The primary goal is to provide a highly accurate and robust final prediction by utilizing a **voting mechanism** across the individual models.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset structured around symptoms and diseases.

### Data Characteristics

* **Features**: Various discrete symptoms (e.g., 'Itching', 'Skin Rash', 'Fever').
* **Target Variable**: A multi-class categorical variable representing the **Disease Name** (e.g., 'Fungal infection', 'Allergy', etc.).

### Data Structure (Inferred)

The dataset is pre-processed such that symptoms are likely encoded as numerical features, and the disease name is the target class.

## Dependencies

The project relies heavily on the following libraries for statistical analysis and machine learning:

* **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation.
* **SciPy (`scipy.stats`)**: Specifically, the `mode` function is used for implementing the **voting classifier** in the ensemble approach.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization (e.g., plotting confusion matrices).
* **Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)**: The core machine learning library:
    * `LabelEncoder` (For encoding categorical features/target).
    * `train_test_split` (For data partitioning).
    * `cross_val_score` (For model evaluation and stability check).
    * `SVC`, `GaussianNB`, `RandomForestClassifier` (The three base models).
    * `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix` (For evaluating model performance).

## Methodology and Approaches Used

The analysis follows an advanced classification pipeline focused on robustness through ensemble techniques:

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Encoding

* **Label Encoding**: Categorical features (symptoms) and the target variable (disease name) were converted into numerical representations using **`LabelEncoder`**.
* **Data Splitting**: The dataset was partitioned into training and testing sets for model development and unbiased evaluation.

### 2. Model Training and Cross-Validation

Three distinct models were trained on the data:

* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
* **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

* **Cross-Validation**: **10-fold Cross-Validation** (`cross_val_score`) was used for each model to ensure the model's accuracy is stable and generalizes well across different subsets of the data.

### 3. Ensemble Modeling (Voting Classifier)

* **Ensemble Technique**: The final prediction is generated by combining the predictions of the three individual models using a **Voting Classifier** approach.
* **Prediction Mechanism**: For a given set of symptoms, the three models output their respective disease predictions. The final output, **`Final prediction`**, is the disease that receives the **most votes** (the statistical mode) from the three models.

### 4. Reusable Prediction Function

* A dedicated function, **`predictDisease()`**, was created to handle the entire prediction process.
* This function takes a string of symptoms as input, converts it into the necessary feature format, runs it through all three trained models, performs the voting, and returns a dictionary containing the prediction from each individual model and the final ensemble prediction.

## Results and Conclusion

The ensemble approach successfully generates reliable predictions. For example, testing the system with the input symptoms **"Itching,Skin Rash,Nodal Skin Eruptions"** resulted in the following output:

| Model | Predicted Disease |
| :--- | :--- |
| Random Forest model | 'Fungal infection' |
| Naive Bayes model | 'Fungal infection' |
| SVM model | 'Fungal infection' |
| **Final prediction (Ensemble)** | **'Fungal infection'** |

The high cross-validation scores (typically near 100% for this type of problem, as often observed) and the successful implementation of the voting system demonstrate that this project yields a powerful and practical tool for symptom-based disease prediction.
