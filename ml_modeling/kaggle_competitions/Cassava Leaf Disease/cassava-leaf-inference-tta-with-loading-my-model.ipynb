The output of this notebook (your trained model) becomes a permanent asset on Kaggle.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Inference Notebook (This Notebook)**\n\nThis notebook is designed specifically for making predictions and generating your submission file. It's built to be lightweight and fast.\n\n* It **doesn't perform any training**. Instead, it **loads the pre-trained model** that you saved as an output from your Training Notebook. To do this, you'll add the Training Notebook's output as an **input dataset** to this Inference Notebook.\n* It then focuses solely on **loading the test data**, using the loaded model to make predictions, and **formatting these predictions into the required `submission.csv` file**.\n* This separation ensures that your submission run is quick and reliable, as it doesn't need to re-train the model every time. Kaggle's submission system will run this entire notebook to generate your final submission.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-19T18:18:29.095771Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-19T18:18:29.096047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-19T18:18:42.897050Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-19T18:18:29.096024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-19T18:18:42.896237Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"2025-08-19 18:18:30.548048: E external/local_xla/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_fft.cc:477] Unable to register cuFFT factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuFFT when one has already been registered\nWARNING: All log messages before absl::InitializeLog() is called are written to STDERR\nE0000 00:00:1755627510.711915      36 cuda_dnn.cc:8310] Unable to register cuDNN factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuDNN when one has already been registered\nE0000 00:00:1755627510.763965      36 cuda_blas.cc:1418] Unable to register cuBLAS factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuBLAS when one has already been registered\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some configuration based on training\nAUTO = tf.data.AUTOTUNE\nIMAGE_SIZE = (512, 512)\nBATCH_SIZE_PER_REPLICA = 8\nNUM_CLASSES = 5\nBATCH_SIZE = 8","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-19T18:19:34.600358Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-19T18:19:34.600626Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-19T18:19:34.604844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-19T18:19:34.600606Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-19T18:19:34.604164Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These two lines define **key file paths** for your Kaggle notebook:\n\n---\n\n* **`DATA_DIR = '/kaggle/input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification'`**\n    This points to the **competition's dataset**, which Kaggle automatically makes available in the `/kaggle/input/` directory.
