      "Content: The Biden administration issued sweeping rules on Monday governing how A.I. chips and models can be shared with foreign countries, in an attempt to set up a global framework that will guide how artificial intelligence spreads around the world in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the power of A.I. rapidly growing, the Biden administration said the rules were necessary to keep a transformational technology under the control of the United States and its allies, and out of the hands of adversaries that could use it to augment their militaries, carry out cyberattacks and otherwise threaten the United States.\n",

      "Tech companies have protested the new rules, saying they threaten their sales and the future prospects of the American tech industry.\n",

The United States and 18 of its closest partners — including Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan — are exempted from any restrictions and can buy A.I. chips freely. \n",

      "Author: ['Moises Velasquez-Manoff', 'Anthony Rey Perez', 'Narration Produced', 'Krish Seenivasan', 'Quinton Kamara'] \n",
      "\n",
      "Publish Date: 2025-01-13 00:00:00 \n",
      "\n",
      "Content: Today, however, a small but growing number of Americans prefer to drink their milk raw. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, now stands at the vanguard of this movement. Kennedy has said he drinks raw milk and has criticized what he describes as the Food and Drug Administration’s “aggressive suppression” of raw-milk production, among other things. Enthusiasts anticipate that, as H.H.S. secretary, he would make raw milk easier to acquire — although how remains unclear. Federal regulations prohibit the sale of raw milk across state lines, but where it’s legal, raw milk is regulated by state governments, not federal agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In embracing raw milk, Kennedy is following an established trend as much as leading it. The roots of the movement stretch back decades. The small, independent health-food stores my parents frequented in New Mexico in the 1980s, for example, sold raw milk. (We never partook.) But to hear Mark McAfee tell it, the pandemic supercharged demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "McAfee heads one of the largest producers of raw milk in the country, Raw Farm in California. McAfee, who has said Kennedy is a customer, has applied to serve in an advisory role at H.H.S. — at the urging of Kennedy’s transition team, he says. During the pandemic, McAfee told me, people felt abandoned by medical professionals and began researching ways to care for their own immune systems. Many turned to raw milk, which he calls “the first food of life.” Maybe they thought it could protect them from the coronavirus, he says, an unproven idea that may stem from the observation that human breast milk provides nursing infants with some protection against infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anecdotes of seemingly miraculous cures from raw milk also help fuel the phenomenon — inflammatory diseases that go into remission, allergies and digestive problems that disappear. McAfee eagerly shared such stories. Nonetheless, his customers defy easy categorization. When he began selling raw milk 25 years ago, hippie “nut-and-berry moms” and natural foodies, as he puts it, formed McAfee’s core clientele. But as his sales have grown — about 30-fold since then, he estimates — his customers have diversified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today’s raw-milk movement is made up of people and ideas from across the political spectrum: back-to-the-land types seeking unadulterated whole foods; health fanatics seeking the latest superfood; don’t-tell-me-what-to-eat libertarians who distrust authority and who, in McAfee’s description, intend to do the opposite of whatever the F.D.A. says. A variety of labels have been applied to the movement: “food sovereignty,” “slow food,” “real food,” “food freedom.” For the more conspiratorially minded, raw milk represents food free of government meddling. For those merely chasing the latest fad, raw milk may be a status symbol — a single gallon can cost nearly $20. \n",

      "Publish Date: 2025-01-13 00:00:00 \n",
      "\n",
      "Content: Social Security has faced a financing shortfall for years, partly because of demographic shifts. Falling birthrates mean fewer people are paying into the program, thousands of baby boomers are retiring daily, and retirees are collecting benefits for longer periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“America’s demographic realities are increasingly challenging for financing programs like Social Security,” said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit. “Net immigration into the country is one factor that has positively pushed against that trend and helped fill the gap left by an aging work force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The trust fund that pays Social Security’s retiree benefits is expected to run dry in 2033, when tax revenue will be enough to pay 79 percent of scheduled benefits. That means beneficiaries’ checks would be reduced by 21 percent if Congress did nothing. (Legislators are expected to do something, though there is a debate about the best approach to shore up the program.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Major shifts to immigration policy could have ripple effects on Social Security. The net immigration rate was projected to drive population growth — and account for all population increases beginning in 2040 because American fertility rates are so low, according to a 2024 report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the immigrant work force declines, that will likely worsen Social Security’s financial picture in the near term and require more significant reforms elsewhere,” said Mr. Akabas of the Bipartisan Policy Center, which recently studied the issue. “That said, the broader questions of immigration policy and border security require careful thought that goes beyond their impact on the Social Security program.” \n",

      "And it does love, and love to chastise, a woman like Rose, the hellbent stage mother at the center of “Gypsy.” Since she first arrived on Broadway in 1959, she has been called a termagant, a gargoyle, a monster — and that’s just by reviewers from The New York Times. But as Audra McDonald is proving to devastating effect in George C. Wolfe’s current revival, Rose is deeply human. Always has been.\n",
